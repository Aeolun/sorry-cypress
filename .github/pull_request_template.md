--- Side note ---

Your contribution is very valuable, we **really appreciate your time and effort**!

Please note:

- Adding a new code and / or feature complicates the maintenance
- Most people disappear after contributing a feature, leaving the support to core maintainers

Given that, please don't be offended if your PR is rejected or significantly modified.
